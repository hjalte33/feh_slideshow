# feh_slideshow
A small python wrapper for the feh image viewer on linux. It's made for my mom so it's easy to start a slideshow.
I made this in my frustration that there isn't any software for linux specifcly for showing a slideshow from a folder, and i needed this to be as easy as posible for my mom to figure out. 
It is basically a small gui for executing a Feh command in linux that then runs a slideshow.
The GUI is in danish but the code is written in english and it's fairly easy to change the gui labels.

The code it pretty hacked together at the moment and im still working on it, but feel free to use and modify any of the code, and feel free to make pull requests. I would love getting some help hacking this together.
